### This Week's Key Topics

+ When to use Factorial ANOVA

+ What is an interaction?

+ Interpreting and reporting the results of Factorial ANOVA

+ Power Analyses with Factorial ANOVAs

---
### Recap from last week

+ ANOVAs can be used to compare more than two means. 

  + One-Way ANOVA tests for mean differences in the dependent variable between 3 or more levels of a single independent variable. 
  
  + **Factorial (Multiway) ANOVA** tests for mean differences in the dependent variable across &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; independent variables

--

+ A Factorial ANOVA requires:

  + A continuous dependent variable
  
  + 2 or more categorical independent variables (with at least 2 levels each)

---
### Factorial ANOVA

+ Factorial ANOVAs test for mean differences in the dependent variable across &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; independent variables

  + Between-Subjects Factorial ANOVA - all IVs are between-subjects 
  
  + Within-Subjects Factorial ANOVA - all IVs are within-subjects
  
  + Mixed Factorial ANOVA - both between- and within-subjects IVs are included in the analysis

---
### Factorial ANOVA

+ Compares the mean of the dependent variable across multiple levels of multiple independent variable

+ When using factorial ANOVA, you can test for both main effects and interactions

  + When multiple independent variables are included in the model, the **main effects** capture the effect of each independent variable, while holding the other independent variable(s) constant.
  
  + The **interaction** captures the how the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable *changes* across levels of the other independent variable
  
  + This is also known as **moderation**, as the effect or association between two variables is being moderated by a third.

## Questions?

---
### Hypotheses

+ Because there are multiple independent variables, there are also multiple possible hypotheses.

  + Hypotheses about main effects
  
  + Hypothesis about interaction

+ A key consideration when working with tests that produce multiple results is to be sure the research aims and hypotheses align with the focus in the results and discussion. 

---
### Example Scenario

.pull-left[
+ A researcher investigates how type of facial coverage and stimulus ethnicity affect recognition of facial expressions.

+ **Independent Variables:**
  + Facial Coverage (no coverage/mask/sunglasses)
  + Stimulus Ethnicity (In-Group/Out-Group)

+ **Dependent Variable:** Recognition Score
]

.pull-right[

![](Week05_ANOVAII_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;


]

---
### Example Scenario

+ The researcher wants to test for 3 possible effects:

  + Is there an effect of facial coverage on expression recognition in children?
  
  + Is there an effect of stimulus ethnicity (in-group/out-group) on expression recognition in children?
  
  + Does the effect of facial coverage on expression recognition differ based on stimulus ethnicity?
  
  
+ All 3 effects can be tested with a single test.

--

** Test Your Understanding:** Which of the above questions reference a main effect and which reference an interaction?

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

+ Recall from last week that ANOVAs evaluate two features in our data:

  + Variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{model}\)`)
  
  + Variance in the dependent variable *not* explained by the independent variable ( `\(SS_{residual}\)`)

--

+ With a Factorial ANOVA, the only difference is that `\(SS_{model}\)` is comprised of the variance from each indepedent variable and their interaction(s):

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

.pull-left[
+ Recall that `\(SS_{model}\)` is calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

+ If there is one IV with 3 groups, this distance is computed between the grand mean and each individual within each of the groups.

---
### The Logic Behind Factorial ANOVA

.pull-left[
+ When there are multiple IVs, `\(SS_{model}\)` is still calculated as the distance between the means of each group and the grand mean. 

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** You have 2 between-subjects IVs. One has 2 levels and one has 3 levels. How many total possible groups do you have?

### Questions?

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

+ 3 hypotheses (2 main effects and 1 interaction):

  + RQ1 - Does facial coverage type affect recognition of facial expression?
      + `\(H_1\)` Type of facial coverage has an effect on recognition of facial expression
  
  + RQ2 - Is there an effect of stimulus ethnicity on recognition of facial expression?
      + `\(H_1\)` Participants are more likely to recognise facial expressions in members of their own ethnic group.
    
  + RQ3 - Does the effect of facial coverage on expression recognition change depending upon stimulus ethnicity?
      + `\(H_1\)` The effect of facial coverage on expression recognition is dependent upon stimulus group.

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

+ Main Effects Hypotheses:
  
  + Main Effect of Coverage:
      + `\(H_0: \mu_{none} = \mu_{mask} = \mu_{sunglasses}\)`
      + `\(H_1:\)` at least one `\(\mu\)` is different from the other `\(\mu\)`s
    
  + Main Effect of Stimulus Ethnicity:
      + `\(H_0: \mu_{consistent} = \mu_{inconsistent}\)`
      + `\(H_1: \mu_{consistent} \neq \mu_{inconsistent}\)`
    
+ Interaction Effect Hypotheses:
      + `\(H_0: C = 0\)`
      + `\(H_1: C \neq 0\)`

&lt;font size="3"&gt; 

  `\(C = (\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{none}-\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{mask}-\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{sunglasses}) - (\mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{none}-\mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{mask}-\mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{sunglasses})\)` 
  
  &lt;b&gt; OR &lt;/b&gt;
  
  `\(C = (\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{none}-\mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{none})-(\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{mask} - \mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{mask})-(\mu_{consistent}\times\mu_{sunglasses}-\mu_{inconsistent}\times\mu_{sunglasses})\)` 
  
&lt;/font&gt;


---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 2: Conduct a Power Analysis**

+ [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index)

+ A power analysis should be conducted for each effect of interest

&gt; **Test your Understanding:** How many power analyses should be run in this instance?

--

+ Let's run an a priori power analysis to detect effect size

  + These are useful when working with secondary data, where you already have a pre-existing dataset
  
  + Here, you calculate the effect size you can detect with a given sample.
  
  + Our dataset has 120 participants. Check the effect size we have 80% power to detect, given `\(\alpha\)` = .05.

+ Remember, Webpower computes the effect size `\(f\)`. We'll need to convert it back to `\(\eta^2\)` using the following formula:

`$$\eta^2 = \frac{f^2}{1+f^2}$$`

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 3: Check your data**

+ Compute descriptive statistics

+ Look at relevant plots
  
--

+ Open [these data](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Data/coverageData.sav) in SPSS.



---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed

--

  + What are residuals, and why should they be normally distributed?

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 4: Check Assumptions**

+ **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed
    + Have a look at the histograms &amp; QQ-plots
  
+ **Independence:** Observations/individuals should be sampled independently
    + Consider study design
  
+ **Homogeneity of Variance:** Equal variance between each group/category
    + Visually assess the residuals vs predicted values plot
    + Support this with Levene's Test for between-subjects variables and Mauchly's test for within-subjects variables with &gt; 2 levels

### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 5: Run the test**

**Step 6: Calculate the effect size**

**Step 7: Interpret results**

Let's continue in SPSS...


---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

We conducted a **2x3 Between-Subjects Factorial ANOVA** to determine the effect of &lt;span style = "color:#BB5A73"&gt; &lt;b&gt; facial coverage (levels: none; mask; sunglasses) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;span style = "color:#BB5A73"&gt; &lt;b&gt; stimulus ethnicity (levels: in-group; out-group) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;span style = "color:#BB5A73"&gt; &lt;b&gt; facial expression recognition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The `\(\alpha\)` threshold was set at .05 for all analyses. An a priori power analysis indicated that 120 participants were sufficient to detect an interaction effect of `\(\eta^2\)` = .08 with a power of 80% and an `\(\alpha\)` threshold of .05.

Facial coverage had a significant effect on expression recognition, &lt;span style = "color:#DFAA73"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 114) = 20.49, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, `\(\eta^2_p\)` = .26 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. However, stimulus group was not associated with expression recognition, &lt;span style = "color:#DFAA73"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(1, 144) = 0.53, `\(p\)` = .470, `\(\eta^2_p\)` = .005 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. 

---
### Running a Factorial ANOVA

**Step 8: Report**

There was a significant interaction between facial coverage and stimulus ethnicity on expression recognition, &lt;span style = "color:#DFAA73"&gt;&lt;b&gt; `\(F\)`(2, 114) = 5.79, `\(p\)` = .004, `\(\eta^2_p\)` = .09 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (see Figure 1). Simple effects analyses were conducted to probe the interaction. Significant effects were found in both in-group, ** `\(F\)`(2, 114) = 9.44, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, `\(\eta^2_p\)` = .14**, and out-group, ** `\(F\)`(2, 114) = 16.85, `\(p\)` &lt; .001, `\(\eta^2\)` = .23**, conditions. 

Participants who viewed stimuli whose ethnicity was consistent with their own recognised significantly more expressions in stimuli with no facial coverage than those wearing sunglasses, &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; `\(p\)` &lt; .001. &lt;/span&gt; Additionally, they recognised more expressions in those with masks than those with sunglasses, &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; `\(p\)` = .015. &lt;/span&gt; There was no difference in recognition when stimuli were wearing masks and when they had no facial coverage, &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; `\(p\)` = .485. &lt;/span&gt;

Participants viewing stimuli inconsistent with their ethnicity recognised significantly more expressions when stimuli had no facial coverage, as opposed to when they were wearing masks &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; ( `\(p\)` &lt; .001) &lt;/span&gt; or sunglasses &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; ( `\(p\)` &lt; .001) &lt;/span&gt;. There was no difference in recognition when stimuli were wearing masks versus when they were wearing sunglasses &lt;span style = "color:#F0D264"&gt; ( `\(p\)` = .556) &lt;/span&gt;.

See Table 1 for descriptive data by group.
