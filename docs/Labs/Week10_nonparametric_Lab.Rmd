## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll apply the concepts discussed during this week's lecture. Each lab consists of a range of tasks, with corresponding questions you can answer. Please note that the questions are not required and not marked, although they do provide a helpful source of formative feedback that will help you gauge your understanding. 

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Select appropriate statistical tests when assumptions are violated in analyses with a single independent variable
2. Conduct and interpret the results from a Mann-Whitney U test
3. Conduct and interpret the results from a Kruskal-Wallis test

## Experiment Overview

This week, you will be analysing simulated data around teenage driving. Teenage drivers' safety ratings were investigated in the context of car ownership and passenger type. However, the data did not meet certain assumptions, so you'll need to use appropriate nonparametric methods to analyse it.

The research questions you are testing are:

1. Does car ownership affect the safety ratings of teenage drivers?

2. Does passenger type affect the safety ratings of teenage drivers? Specifically, are safety ratings different when a teenager is driving by themselves, a parent or a friend?

The dataset contains the following variables:

```{r, echo = F}
dat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week10LabData.csv')

datInfo <- data.frame(VariableName = colnames(dat),
                      Description=c('reflects whose vehicle the teenager primarily uses; 0 = parent; 1 = own',
                                    '0 = self; 1 = friend; 2 = parent',
                                    'Scores on a safety rating measure; values may range between 0-100'))

datInfo %>%
  kbl(col.names=c('Variable Name', 'Description')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color=baseColor, font_size = 18, align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, width = '4.5cm')
```

1. Teenagers will drive more safely when they are driving a parent's car compared to when they are driving their own car.

2. Passenger type will affect teenage drivers' safety ratings. Specifically, teenagers will drive more safely when they are driving with their parent as compared to when they are driving by themselves or with a friend.

## Descriptive Data

When working with data that violate assumptions, the mean may not be the best estimate of central tendancy, and the standard deviation may not be the best measure of variance. Depending on the severity of the assumption violation, the median and interquartile range (IQR) may be more representative measures of central tendency and variance.

## Check Assumptions

Although this lab is specifically covering nonparametric analyses (so you already know assumptions will be violated), in a typical setting, you would do this step first, then use the results of these assumptions checks to make a decision about which test to use.

Recall that the assumptions of a both an independent-samples $t$-test and a One-Way ANOVA are:

(1) **Normality:** Values are normally distributed *within levels or groups*

(2) **Independence of Observations:** Individual observations should not be dependent upon any others

(3) **Homogeneity of Variance:** Variances within each level or group should be generally similar


### Your Tasks

For each research question:

<div class="nobullet">
+ [ ] $\ $ Decide whether the data meet the assumption of normality
+ [ ] $\ $ Decide whether the data meet the assumption of independence
+ [ ] $\ $ Decide whether the data meet the assumption of homogeneity
</div>


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

To check normality, you can use histograms and Q-Q plots. You'll need to do this for each level of the independent variables separately. Navigate to *Analyze>DescriptiveStatistics>Explore* to do this. 

Independence is accounted for during study design. To check homogeneity of variance, you can view boxplots and verify using results from Levene's test.

</details>
</div>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>


<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> RQ 1 </span>

To check the histograms and Q-Q plots of the dependent variable separated by Group, click *Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Explore* and add the dependent variable, `SafetyRating`,  to the 'Dependent List' box and the independent variable, `OwnCar`, to the Factor List box. At the bottom, change the 'Display' setting from 'Both' to 'Plots'. Click 'Plots', deselect 'Stem-and-Leaf' and select 'Histograms' instead. Tick the box that says 'Normality Plots with Tests'. Then click the *Untransformed* option under 'Spread vs Level with Levene Test'. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_parentCarHist.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_ownCarHist.png')
```

Here, `SafetyRating` is definitely negatively skewed, particularly in the group that drives their own car. This is evidence of a significant normality violation.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_parentCarQQ.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_ownCarQQ.png')
```

Inspecting the Q-Q plots, note that the points curve around the line across the entire range of data. This further confirms that normality has been violated, particularly in the group that drives their own car. 

As independence should be accounted for through study design (and cannot be adjusted statistically after data collection), we'll consider it met in this example.

Have a look at the boxplot to evaluate homogeneity of variance. If the boxes in the boxplot are approximately the same size, it would give confidence that this assumption has been met.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_ownershipBoxplot.png')
```

In this case, there is more variance in `SafetyRating` in the group that drives their own car compared to the group that drives their parent's. 

Next, check the results from Levene's test to confirm. Check the line that says 'Based on Mean' and evaluate the 'Sig.' column. With $\alpha$ = .05, `SafetyRating` violates the assumption of equal variances, as $p$ = .006, which is lower than the $\alpha$ threshold. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_ttestLevene.png')
```

<br>

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> RQ 2 </span>

To check assumptions for RQ2, navigate to *Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Explore*. Keep `SafetyRating`, in the 'Dependent List' box and swap the independent/grouping variable to `Passenger`, in the 'Factor List' box. All other options should stay the same.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_selfHist.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_parentHist.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_friendHist.png')
```

As before, `SafetyRating` within each group does not appear to follow a normal distribution. The Q-Q plots support this:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_selfQQ.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_parentQQ.png')

knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_friendQQ.png')
```

Here, `SafetyRating` is definitely negatively skewed, particularly in the group that drives their own car. This is evidence of a significant normality violation.

As before, we'll assume independence is met in this example.

Check the boxplot to evaluate homogeneity of variance.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_passengerBoxplot.png')
```

In this case, there is less variance in `SafetyRating` in the group that drives with their friends compared to the group that drives with their parents. 

The results from Levene's test further confirm this. With $\alpha$ = .05, `SafetyRating` violates the assumption of equal variances, as $p$ = .011. 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_ANOVAlevene.png')

## RQ1 Primary Analysis

The first research question is:

*Does car ownership affect the safety ratings of teenage drivers?*


```{r RQ1test, echo = F}
quiz(caption = '',
     question('If assumptions had been, which test would be used to measure RQ1?',
              answer('Independent-samples t-test', correct = T),
              answer('Paired-samples t-test'),
              answer('One-Way Between-Subjects ANOVA'),
              answer('One-Way Repeated-Measures ANOVA'),
              answer('Factorial ANOVA'),
              answer('Correlation'),
              message = "The outcome is continuous. The independent variable is a binary categorical variable (own vehicle or parent's vehicle). Had assumptions been met, an independent-samples t-test would be used."))
```

In this case, the data violated assumptions, and so a nonparametric test should be used.

### Your Task

<div class="nobullet">
+ [ ] $\ $ Run a Mann-Whitney U test and interpret the results with $\alpha$ = .05.

</div>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

To perform a nonparametric test, navigate to *Analyze>Nonparametric Tests>Independent Samples...*.

</details>
</div>
</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

Navigate to *Analyze>Nonparametric Tests>Independent Samples...*. Click the 'Fields' tab at the top of the box that appears. Add `SafetyRating` to the 'Test Fields' box and `OwnCar` to the 'Groups' box. Then click 'Run' at the bottom. This option automatically detects the levels in your variable and chooses the corresponding test (in this case, the Mann-Whitney U test)

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_mwTest.png')
```

The output of a Mann-Whitney U test is not based on a comparison of the mean values of each group, but the mean rank of the values in the group. The group with the highest `SafetyRating` values overall will also have the highest mean rank. In this case, the safety ratings of teenagers driving their parent's car were ranked higher than the safety ratings than those driving their own car. The associated $p$-value is .022, which is lower than the $\alpha$ threshold of .05, so this difference is considered significant. 

</details>
</div>
</br>

## RQ2 Primary Analysis

The second research question is:

*Does passenger type affect the safety ratings of teenage drivers?*


```{r RQ2test, echo = F}
quiz(caption = '',
     question('If assumptions had been, which test would be used to measure RQ2?',
              answer('Independent-samples t-test'),
              answer('Paired-samples t-test'),
              answer('One-Way Between-Subjects ANOVA', correct = T),
              answer('One-Way Repeated-Measures ANOVA'),
              answer('Factorial ANOVA'),
              answer('Correlation'),
              message = "The outcome is continuous. There is one categorical independent variable with 3 levels (self, friend, or parent) and between-subjects (each participant was only part of a single group. Had assumptions been met, one-way between-subjects ANOVA would be used."))
```

In this case, the data violated assumptions, so a nonparametric test should be used.

### Your Task

<div class="nobullet">
+ [ ] $\ $ Run a Kruskal-Wallis test and interpret the results with $\alpha$ = .05.

</div>


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

As in the previous analysis, navigate to *Analyze>Nonparametric Tests>Independent Samples...*.

</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

As before, navigate to *Analyze>Nonparametric Tests>Independent Samples...*. Click the 'Fields' tab at the top of the box that appears. Swap `OwnCar` with `Passenger` in the 'Groups' box, then click 'Run'.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_kwTest.png')
```

Like the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test is not based on a comparison of the mean values of each group, but the mean rank of the values in the group. Here, there was a significant difference in ranking distributions between the three passenger groups, indicated by the $p$-value of .026.

A posthoc Dunn's test is also run automatically, allowing you to probe this effect further:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week10_pwc.png')
```

Note that the $p$-values have been adjusted for multiple corrections here. The posthoc test shows that there's a significant difference in `SafetyRatings` when teenagers drive with a friend vs a parent, but no significant differences in the other comparisons.


</details>
</div>
</br>

## Interpret & Report

There are many ways you could write this up, but you'll need to at least include the following information:

+ alpha level
+ number of participants (n)
+ participant demographics (mean age, age sd, and age range of sample; gender distribution of sample)
+ results from assumptions checks
+ descriptive data for each IV group (M and SD)
+ the type of test used
+ variables involved in the tests
+ test statistic (U or H)
+ degrees of freedom (kruskal-wallis only)
+ p-values

Note that when reporting statistics that include brackets (e.g., those that reference degrees of freedom), separate them from the text using a comma. When reporting statistics that do not include brackets, separate them from text using brackets.

*Note that this report is not entirely complete; there is no description of the sample. You can find examples of this in previous labs*

In this analysis, we tested how driver safety ratings were affected when teenagers were driving their own car, as compared to driving their parents. Additionally, we investigated whether the identity of the passenger affected how safely a teenager drove.Visual assessment of histograms and Q-Q plots indicated that the safety ratings were not normally distributed. Additionally, homogeneity of variance (as assessed through visual assessment of the boxplot and confirmed via Levene's test) was violated. Due to these violations, we used nonparametric assessments to test our hypotheses. Tests were evaluated at an $\alpha$ threshold of .05.

A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that teenagers who drove their own cars had significantly lower safety ratings (median = 71.31, IQR = 21.28) than those who drove their parents ($U$ = 295.50, $p$ = .022; median = 77.49, IQR = 13.00). 

A Kruskal-Wallis test showed that passenger type significantly affected safety ratings, $H$(2) = 7.31, $p$ = .026. Posthoc effects were evaluated using Dunn's test; Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. These indicated that teenagers drove significantly more safely when they were driving with their parents (median = 78.04, IQR = 12.96) than with their friends ($p_{adjusted}$ = .022, median = 70.36, IQR = 23.17). There was no significant difference in their safety when they were driving with their parents or by themselves ($p_{adjusted}$ = .285, median = 73.95, IQR = 16.44). There was also no significant difference in their driving safety when they were by themselves or with their friends ($p$ = .945).
