## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll apply the concepts discussed during this week's lecture. Each lab consists of a range of tasks, with corresponding questions you can answer. Please note that the questions are not required and not marked, although they do provide a helpful source of formative feedback that will help you gauge your understanding. 

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Identify hypotheses which may be tested using correlations
2. Use SPSS to compute a composite score
3. Use SPSS to run both a Pearson and Spearman correlation
4. Properly interpret and report both a Pearson and Spearman correlation
5. Produce an APA-style correlation matrix table


### This Week's Study

You'll be working with data adapted from [this study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1612197X.2017.1367951#d1e287). The researchers investigated adolescent athletes who played team sports. One area the study investigated was whether self-enhancement values (e.g., valuing power and achievement) were associated with antisocial behaviour towards members of the opposing team. You'll be investigating this association directly; you'll also produce plots using other related variables in the dataset.


## Experiment Overview

<br>
In this experiment, you recruited a sample of adolescents who participated in team sports. Participants have an average score for each of 4 measures associated with desire for power and achievement from the Portrait Values Questionnaire. These scores, when totaled together, will provide a measure that reflects a participant's self-enhancement values. Higher scores on this composite metric reflect stronger self-enhancement values. Participants also have an Antisocial Behaviour score, which reflects their average score on the antisocial items from the Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior in Sport Scale. Higher scores on this scale reflect a larger number of endorsed antisocial behaviours.  

You can download the dataset from the first experiment [here](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week6LabData.sav). It contains the following variables:

```{r, echo = F}
dat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week6LabData.csv')
datInfo <- data.frame(VariableName = colnames(dat),
                      Description=c('Participant ID',
                                    'Age in years',
                                    'Levels: F = Female; M = Male',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 1; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 2; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 3; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Self-Enhancment Score 4; values may range between 0 - 6',
                                    'Total Antisocial Behaviour Score; values may range from 5-25'))

datInfo %>%
  kbl(col.names=c('Variable Name', 'Description')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color=baseColor, font_size = 18, align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, width = '4.5cm')
```

You'll be investigating the association between student athletes' endorsement of self-enhancement values and reports of their antisocial behaviour towards members of the opposing team.

```{r q1, echo = FALSE}

              answer("Correlation", correct = T),
              message = "Here, you're looking at the association between two continuous variables. Both a t-test and a Factorial ANOVA require a categorical dependent variable, so a correlation is the most appropriate of these three."),

## Data Review

Before running any analyses, you should first check your data. In many cases, some kind of cleaning or data wrangling will be necessary. For instance, are there any missing values? Do you have any unexpected values or extreme outliers? Do you need to create a variable from the existing data (e.g., a summary metric for a cognitive task)? These things should be dealt with before conducting the analyses.

Additionally, you'll need to compute descriptive data. You'll do this for both your main variables of interest and your sample's demographic data, as this must be included in the Sample portion of your Methods section. 

### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Open 'Week7LabData.sav'

+ [ ] $\ $ Check that all variables are set as the correct measurement type. 

+ [ ] $\ $ Check the descriptive statistics of your data


```{r cyrDesc, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question_numeric('What is the maximum value for AntisocialBehaviour?',
                      answer(190, correct = T),
                      message = "The maximum Antisocial Behaviour score is 190, which is well outside the expected limits of 5-25. As a score of 190 is not possible, it is an error. It will need to be deleted so that it is excluded from further analysis."))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

For continuous variables, check mean and standard deviation. It's also useful to check the minimum and maximum so you can easily identify values outside of your expected range. For categorical variables, check the frequency of participants in each group. It may also be useful to check the mode.

</details>
</div>
</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Adjust Variable Measure Format </span>

To check that your variables are labeled as the correct scale of measurement, look at the **Measure** column under the *Variable View* tab.

* `ID` - Ordinal

* `Age` - Scale

* `Gender` - Nominal

* `SE1` - Ordinal

* `SE2` - Ordinal

* `SE3` - Ordinal

* `AntisocialBehaviour` - Scale

* `SEcategory` - Nominal

* `ParentalPressure` - Nominal

<br>
<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Check Descriptive Statistics </span>

**Categorical Variables:** Your categorical variables are `Gender`, `SEcategory`, `ParentalPressure`, `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3` and `SE4`. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add these variables to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is checked, then click 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_freqTables.png')
```

You might also find it helpful to check the mode of the `SE` variables.

**Continuous Variables:** `AntisocialBehaviour` is a continuous variable. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add `AntisocialBehaviour` to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is not ticked, then click 'Statistics'. Tick 'Mean', 'Std. Deviation', 'Minimum', and 'Maximum'. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week6_behavDesc.png')
```

Note that the maximum value for `AntisocialBehaviour` is 190, which is not a valid score. This is an error, so you'll need to remove it from your data so that it is not included in further analysis. To do this, find the value in your dataset under 'Data View' and delete it.

## Create a Composite Score

Sometimes when performing a study, it is necessary to compute a composite summary metric for use in analysis. This composite score may be an average or a sum of other measured variables.

### Your Task

+ [ ] $\ $ Compute a total score, `SelfEnhancement`, by summing the following columns: `SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, and `SE4`

+ [ ] $\ $ Check the appropriate descriptive statistics for `SelfEnhancement`



```{r cyrComp, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
    question_numeric("What is the mean score on SelfEnhancement? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
                      answer(12.41, correct = T),
                      answer(12.42, correct = T),
                      message = "The mean SelfEnhancement score in your sample is currently 12.42. If you remove the participant with the invalid score for Antisocial Behaviour, the mean SelfEnhancement score will drop slightly to 12.41."))
```


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>
To compute the self-enhancement composite score, you'll need to navigate to *Transform > Compute Variable*

As `SelfEnhancement` is a continuous variable, the descriptive statistics you'll want to check are mean and standard deviation. It's also useful to check the minimum and maximum so you can easily identify values outside of your expected range.

<br>
<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Compute Composite Score </span>

To compute the composite score by summing together the SE columns, navigate to *Transform > Compute Variable*. Label your new variable `SelfEnhancement` in the 'Target Variable' box. In the 'Numeric Expression', add each SE column (`SE1`, `SE2`, `SE3`, and `SE4`) with a $+$ sign between them:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_composite.png')
```

Click 'OK'. A new column labeled `SelfEnhancement` should appear that contains the sum of the 4 SE columns.

<br>
<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Check Descriptive Statistics </span>

Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies* and add `SelfEnhancment` to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is not ticked, then click 'Statistics'. Tick 'Mean', 'Std. Deviation', 'Minimum', and 'Maximum'. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '40%'}

## Run a Pearson Correlation

As you are testing for an association between two continuous variables, you'll use a correlation to provide statistical support for your hypotheses. 

Recall that $r$ has the following interpretation standards:

| Strength     | Absolute Magnitude of $r$ |
|:------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Negligible   | $<$ .1                    |
| Weak         | .1 - .3                   |
| Moderate     | .3 - .5                   |
| Strong       | $>$ .5                    |


### Your Task

+ [ ] $\ $ Run a correlation to test your hypotheses and interpret the results with $\alpha$ = .05. Note that you should run the correlation between the total self-enhancement score, `SelfEnhancment` and `AntisocialBehaviour`.


```{r cyrCorr, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question_numeric("What is the Pearson correlation value for the association between AntisocialBehaviour and SelfEnhancement? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
              answer(.30, correct = T),
              message = "Pearson's r for the association between AntisocialBehaviour and SelfEnhancement is .30."))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

To run a correlation, navigate to *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate*

</details>
</div>
</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

To correlate `SelfEnhancement` with `AntisocialBehaviour`, navigate to *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate* and add both of these to the 'Variables' box. You can specify that you'd like to also compute the relevant confidence intervals by selecting 'Confidence interval' box and ticking the 'Estimate confidence intervals of the bivariate correlation parameter' box. Click 'Show only the lower diagonal'; this removes redundant information from the correlation matrix. Click 'Continue' and then 'OK'. You'll get the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_correlationResults.png')
```

The top box provides a correlation matrix with the value of $r$ and the p-value, while the bottom box gives the confidence interval associated with the correlation. Here, you can see that $r$ = .30, which equates to a weak to moderate association between `SelfEnhancement` and `AntisocialBehaviour`. The $p$-value (< .001) is less than the $\alpha$ threshold of .05, so this association is significant. The 95% confidence interval indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true association ($r$) between these two variables falls between .16 and .43. 


</details>
</div>
</br>

## Run a Spearman Correlation

There may be times when you want to check the association between ordinal values, such as those from a Likert Scale. Pearson's correlation is not appropriate for this, as it assumes you're testing for a linear association between two continuous variables. When you have ordinal data, you should instead use Spearman's rank correlation, which tests for a monotonic association (as one variable increases or decreases, so does the other, but it doesn't have to be in a linear fashion). Spearman's correlation is denoted by $\rho$ (rho). 

### Your Task

+ [ ] $\ $ Run a Spearman's rank correlation test between each of the items on the Self-enhancment scale (`SE1`, `SE1`, `SE3`, & `SE4`).


```{r cyrSpearman, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = '',
     question_numeric("What is the value of rho associated with the relationship between SE3 & SE4? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
                      answer(.47, correct = T),
                      message = "Spearman's rho for the association between SE3 & SE4 is .47"),
     question("Which of the following pairs have the weakest association?",
              answer("SE1 & SE2"),
              answer("SE1 & SE3"),
              answer('SE1 & SE4', correct = T),
              message = "Spearman's rho for the association between SE1 & SE4 is only .28. For the association between SE1 & SE3, it is .39, and for the association between SE1 & SE2, it is .51."))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>
You'll find the steps of this to be very similar to the Pearson correlation. Check the 'Correlation Coefficient' options under *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate*

</details>
</div>
</br>


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>
Navigate to *Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate*. Change the tick mark under 'Correlation Coefficients' from 'Pearson' to 'Spearman'. Click 'Flag significant correlations' and 'Show only the lower triangle', then click 'OK'.


```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_SpearmanOptions.png')
```

You'll get the following output, which you can interpret in the same way as Pearson's $r$:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week7_SpearmanResults.png')
```

Here, you can see that all variables are significantly associated with each other, which you would expect given that they are supposed to measure the same construct.

## Produce an APA-style Correlation Table

When a number of correlations are reported, these are most effectively displayed in a table. Tables allow you to present your results more clearly and efficiently than describing them in text alone. As a psychology student, you will almost always need to follow APA-style when producing figures. SPSS does not always produce customisable, APA-style tables (even when you select the option to do so). Here, you'll refer to the [APA-style website](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/tables) to produce an APA-style correlation table.

### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Produce an APA-style correlation table of your Spearman correlation data.


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

I personally find SPSS tables difficult to customise and produce in APA style. It's okay to use Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or another data processing programme of your choice to create your correlation matrix.

[See here](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-tables#correlation) for a specific example of an APA-style correlation table.

</details>
</div>
</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

The steps to produce the table will differ depending upon which software you use to produce it, but the final output should look something like this:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week6_corrTable.png')
```

Note the following:

+ Mode is used as the central tendency metric as these are Likert-style responses

+ Table number is in bold

+ There is a space between the table number and title (which is in italics)

+ There are no vertical lines in the table

+ There are only horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the table and between sections

+ Because correlation values cannot be larger than 1, there is no leading 0 in the correlation values (i.e. .51 not 0.51)

+ The note label is written in italics, with a full stop separating it and the note text. 

+ Check the style guidelines for alignment

</details>
</div>
</br>

## Report & Interpret

Now that you've completed the analyses, write a mini results section describing your findings. In this section, please:

+ Give a brief description of your sample as you would in a methods section. 

+ Report your results and a provide interpretation in APA style. 

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

There are many ways you could write this up, but you'll need to at least include the following information:

+ alpha level
+ number of participants (n)
+ participant demographics (mean age, age $SD$, and age range of sample; gender distribution of sample)
+ correlated variables
+ descriptive data for each IV group (M and SD)
+ the type of test used (one-way or repeated measures?)
+ $r$
+ degrees of freedom (for a correlation, $df = n - 2$)
+ p-value

The proper style of reporting the results from a correlation looks like this:

$r$($df$) = [$r$ value], $p$ = [$p$-value], 95% CI = [lower band, upper band].

In this study, we investigated whether adolescent athletes' self-enhancement values were associated with their antisocial behaviours towards members of the opposing team To do this, we collected data from a sample of 173 adolescents who participate in team sports. One participant was excluded due to an error in the data. Our final sample consisted of 172 adolescent athletes between the ages of 13-19 ($M$ = 15.92, $SD$ = 1.60; 88 Females, 84 Males). 

A composite measure of self-enhancement was computed by summing the values of the 4 questions associated with desire for power and achievement from the Portrait Values Questionnaire. This produced a Self-Enhancement measure with possible values ranging from 0 to 24. Higher values reflected greater levels of self-enhancement.

We used Spearman correlations to test whether scores on each of the four questions on the self-enhancement scale were associated. We ran a Pearson's correlation to test the association between scores on a self-enhancement values scale and the average score on a scale that measured antisocial behaviour.  $\alpha$ was set at .05 for all analyses.

Scores on each of the 4 questions on the self-enhancement scale were moderately positively correlated (see Table 1). Participants scored an average of 12.41 on the self-enhancement scale ( $SD$ = 2.79; minimum = 6.00; maximum = 20.00) and had an average antisocial behaviour rating of 14.99 ( $SD$ = 4.41, minimum = 5, maximum = 25). Results from a Pearson's correlation indicated that there was a moderate, positive relationship between the two variables, $r$(170) = .30, $p$ < .001, 95% CI = [.16, .43], indicating that participants who endorsed stronger self-enhancement values also demonstrated more antisocial behaviours towards members of the opposing team.
