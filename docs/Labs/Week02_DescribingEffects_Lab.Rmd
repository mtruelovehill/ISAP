## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll apply the concepts discussed during this week's lecture. Each lab consists of a range of tasks, with corresponding questions you can answer. Please note that the questions are not required and not marked, although they do provide a helpful source of formative feedback that will help you gauge your understanding. 

Today, you'll be using interactive visualisations to demonstrate the concepts covered in the lecture. You will also learn some SPSS basics.

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Describe the difference between effect sizes and $p$-values
2. Compute confidence intervals
3. Describe general requirements of a power analysis
4. Import data and compute basic descriptive statistics using SPSS

## Interpreting Effect Sizes

Although a $p$-value provides you with evidence of whether the null hypothesis can be rejected, it doesn't provide information about the strength of the effect being tested. Even weak relationships may be significant under certain circumstances. Significance does not guarantee an effect is meaningful. To get a better sense of this, we use effect size. 

The plot below shows the distribution of scores for each of two groups, differentiated by color. Use this plot to explore the relationships between means, standard deviations, effect size, sample size, and the $p$-value. While you interact with the plot, consider the following:

+ How does changing the difference between means affect the effect size? The $p$-value?

+ How does changing the standard deviation affect the effect size? The $p$-value?

+ How does changing the sample size affect the effect size? The $p$-value?

**Please note** that due to the way the data are simulated, there will not be a perfect negative or positive relationship between these values. It's more important that you grasp the general trend in their relationship than note the specific values being produced. The answers to the quiz questions will reflect this.

```{r effSizePlot, echo = F}
fluidRow(column(6,
                selectInput('meanDiff', 'Select the Difference between Group Means:', 
                            choices = list('.5' = .5, '1' = 1, '3' = 3, '5' = 5, '10' = 10)),
                selectInput('n', 'Sample Size per Group:', 
                            choices = list('10' = 10, '30' = 50, '100' = 100, '500' = 500, '1000' = 1000, '5000' = 5000)),

     question("If the difference between means and the group SD is held constant, what generally happens to the p-value when the sample size is increased?",
              answer('The p-value increases'),
              answer('The p-value decreases', correct = T),
              answer('The p-value stays about the same'),
              message = 'Increasing the sample size can also decrease the p-value, causing results to appear more significant even if the effect is quite small.'))
```

## Compute a 95% Confidence Interval 

Recall from the [lecture](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Lectures/Week03_NHST_lecture.html#47) that a 95% confidence level indicates that, were we to collect 100 samples and compute 95% confidence intervals each time, ~95 of those confidence intervals would be expected to contain the true population value. 

Here, we'll perform a simulation to illustrate this idea. 

Imagine that you are testing a new measure of social perception in children. You have gathered data from a large sample of children, but for normative purposes, you'd like identify the expected average for the entire population. While it's not possible to know this average without testing every child in the world, it can be estimated using confidence intervals.

```{r q6, echo = F}
quiz(caption = 'Test Your Understanding',
     question("In the above example, which of the following is the sample?",
              answer("Every child in the world"),
              answer("The children who provided data", correct = T),
              message = 'The population refers to anyone to whom the results can be generalised. In this case, it would be every child in the world. The sample refers to the children who provided data.'),
      question("In the above example, which of the following would be considered the population parameter?",
              answer("The mean social perception score of all children in the world", correct = T),
              answer("The mean social perception score for the children who provided data"),
              message = 'The population parameter is the value we are attempting to estimate by using sample data. In this case, it is the mean score of all children in the world.')
     )
```


We often cannot know the true population parameter, but for the purposes of illustration, let's imagine that we have access to the social perception performance of all children in the world, and it looks something like this:

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
ciDat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/ciDat.csv')

ggplot(ciDat, aes(Cscore)) + geom_histogram(fill = accent3, color = accent2) + 
  xlab('Score') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  annotate('text', label = paste0('Mean = ', round(mean(ciDat$Cscore), 2)), x = 40, y = 700, size = 6)
  
```

```{r q7, echo = F}
quiz(caption = 'Test Your Understanding',
     question_numeric("What is the value of the population parameter in this example? Please round your answer to 2 decimal places.",
              answer(57.97, correct = T),
              message = 'The population parameter is the mean score on the assessment, 57.97.')
     )
```


To demonstrate what the confidence interval tells us, we need to take multiple samples from the population and calculate a confidence interval from each. Given what a 95% confidence interval is telling us, if we were to take 20 separate samples of 50 children and compute a confidence interval with each, we would expect around 19 (95%) of those confidence intervals to include a value of 57.97. 

Use the button to generate 20 new samples. In the plot, the points represent the mean of each sample, and the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals. The true population mean is represented by the green line. Red error bars indicate confidence intervals that do not include the true population mean. If you were to press the button many times, eventually you would find that, on average, 95% of the confidence intervals contain the true population mean of 57.97.

```{r, echo = F}
actionButton("do", "Collect 20 Samples")
plotOutput('ciPlot')
```

You'll also note that while each sample's mean falls near the true population value, it is rare for a sample mean to perfectly capture the population mean. Confidence intervals are useful because they are more likely than the sample mean to capture the population mean.

```{r q8, echo = F}
quiz(caption = 'Test Your Understanding',
     question("Margot conducted a memory test on a sample of students, and found that the mean score was 75 points, with a 95% confidence interval of 65 - 85. Which of the following can she conclude?",
              answer('If Margot were to conduct this test over and over, 95% of the sample would always achieve a score between 65 and 85 points.'),
              answer('There is a .95 probability that the population mean is between 65 and 85 points.'),
              answer('If she calculated the 95% CI using the same method on a large number of samples, 95% of those CIs would contain the population mean. Therefore, she can be 95% confident that her CI of 65-85 contains the population mean.', correct = T),
              answer('She can be 95% confident that her results are accurate.'),
              message = 'The population mean is fixed, so any individual confidence interval that has already been calculated either contains the population mean or does not contain it. However, if you calculate an X% confidence interval on multiple samples, then X% of those intervals will contain the population mean.'))
```

## Power Analyses

In this course, we'll be using [WebPower](https://webpower.psychstat.org/wiki/models/index) to conduct power analyses. We'll begin to conduct power analyses when we run specific statistical tests. Today, focus on improving your understanding of the concept of statistical power. Have a look at the following power curves and spend some time trying to interpret them.

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 8, fig.height=4}

powerDat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Data/powerDat.csv')
powerDat$EffectSize <- factor(powerDat$EffectSize, levels = c('strong', 'moderate', 'weak'))

(powPlot <- ggplot(powerDat, aes(SampleSize, Power, color = EffectSize)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'Sample Size', y = 'Power', color = 'Effect Size') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 200, by = 20)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = .1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(accent2, accent1, baseColor), labels = c('Strong', 'Moderate', 'Weak')) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = 'bold'),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)))
```

As you interpret this plot, try to answer the following questions:

+ What is the effect of sample size on power?

+ What is the effect of effect size on power?

+ About how many participants are necessary to detect a moderate effect with 80% power? 

+ If you expect a weak effect but have only 50 participants, what is your likelihood of making a Type II error?

```{r q9, echo = FALSE}
 quiz(caption = 'Test Your Understanding',
      question('What is the traditional threshold for power that is considered acceptable?',
               answer('70%'),
               answer('80%', correct = T),
               answer('90%'),
               answer('100%'),
               message = 'Traditionally, a threshold of 80% is considered an acceptable level of power for a study.'),
      question('Which of the following is not directly considered when calculating power?',
               answer('Sample variance', correct = T),
               answer('Sample size'),
               answer('Significance level'),
               answer('Effect size'),
               random_answer_order = T,
               message = 'Power is affected by the significance level, sample size, and effect size. Each of these four values is a function of the remaining three.'),
      question('Which of the following would lead to an increase in statistical power? Please select all that apply.',
               answer('Decreasing alpha'),
               answer('Increasing effect size', correct = T),
               answer('Using a two-tailed test instead of a one-tailed test'),
               answer('Increasing the number of participants in the sample', correct = T),
               random_answer_order = T,
               message = 'Power has a positive relationship with all of the given values, so that as effect size, sample size, and alpha increase, so too does power. Decreasing any of these lowers power. Going from a one-tailed to a two-tailed test decreases alpha by splitting it between each tail, so this would also lower power.'),
      question('You run a power analysis and find that, for your analysis, you will need 136 participants to have 80% power to detect a moderate effect (d = .5). Which of the following statements are true? Please select all that apply.',
               answer('If you recruit fewer than 136 participants, your chances of detecting an existing effect will decrease.', correct = T),
               answer('If you recruit at least 136 participants, you have an 80% chance of getting statistically significant results.'),
               answer('If you recruit 136 participants, you have a 20% chance of making a Type II error.', correct = T),
               answer('If the actual effect in the population is weaker than d = .5, 136 participants will still provide sufficient power to detect it.'),
               answer('If the actual effect in the population is stronger than d = .5, 136 participants will still provide sufficient power to detect it.', correct = T),
               random_answer_order = T,
               message = 'You only have an 80% chance of getting statistically significant results IF the effect actually exists. Additionally, reducing the effect size decreases power, so you will need to increase your sample size in order to detect a smaller effect. Increasing the effect size increases power, so you will still be sufficiently powered to detect a larger effect without changing the sample.')
      )
```

<i><b> What is the effect of sample size on power? What is the effect of effect size on power? </i></b>

The sample size values can be found on the x-axis of the plot. As these values increase, you can see that power increases as well. Each line represents a different effect size strength. A strong effect size provides more power than a moderate effect size, which provides more power than a weak effect size. 

</br>
<i><b> About how many participants are necessary to detect a moderate effect with 80% power? </i></b>

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
powPlot + 
  geom_segment(x = 0, xend = 63, y = .8, yend = .8, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_segment(x = 63, xend = 63, y = 0, yend = .8, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_point(x = 63, y = .8, shape = 8, size = 2)
```

If we check the line associated with moderate strength, we can see that we need about 63 participants to achieve a power of 80%.

</br>

<i><b> If you expect a weak effect but have only 50 participants, what is your likelihood of making a Type II error? </i></b>

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
powPlot + 
  geom_segment(x = 0, xend = 50, y = .16, yend = .16, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_segment(x = 50, xend = 50, y = 0, yend = .16, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_point(x = 50, y = .16, shape = 8, size = 2)
```

By checking the line associated with a weak effect size, we can see that 50 participants is associated with a power of about .16. To calculate the chances of making a Type II error using our power value, we need to subtract .16 from 1. This leaves us with .84, meaning we have about an 84% chance of making a Type II error. In other words, we have a high likelihood of failing to identify an existing effect.

## Using SPSS - Accessing Data

In this course, you'll be using SPSS to perform the majority of your tasks. You can download today's data onto your device by <B>[clicking here](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week2LabData.sav)</B> or checking this week's folder on [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/ultra/) (requires university login). 

### Your Tasks
+ Download this week's lab data, 'Week2LabData.sav'
+ Move it to your course folder and open it with SPSS.
+ Check each variable's measurement type and correct if necessary

```{r accessData, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Understanding',
     question('Which of the following "Measure" values used by SPSS reflects categorical data? Please select all that apply.',
              answer('Nominal', correct = T),
              answer('Ordinal', correct = T),
              answer('Scale'),
              message = 'Scale can be used for both types of continuous data (ratio and interval scales of measurement), but categorical
              variables are split into nominal and ordinal measures. Remember that nominal data reflect purely independent categories,
              but ordinal data have some sort of implied order (e.g. Likert Scale data, level of education).'))
```

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

Check under the **File** tab in SPSS to open the data. Use the *Variable View* in the main data window to adjust each variable's measurement type. Do the labels used by SPSS match the scales of measurement expected (i.e. nominal, ordinal, ratio, interval?) Note that *Scale* is SPSS's label for both ratio and interval data.

</details>
</div>

</br>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>
Click *Open* under the **File** tab.  Navigate to the folder where you've stored  'Week2LabData.sav' and select the file. Once data have been imported, check the measure type in the *Variable View* tab:

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week1_variableView.png')
```

SPSS labels the data as:

* _Nominal:_ data that fall into discrete categories that have no information regarding order (e.g., eye colour)
* _Ordinal:_ data that fall into discrete categories that have some kind of meaningful ordering information (e.g. Likert Scale responses)
* _Scale:_ continuous/numerical data; data have some kind of numeric relationship and could technically be measured to infinite decimal places, if the measurement was actually capable of doing so.


To adjust the measure type, select the Measure box for a single variable and click the arrow that appears.

* `ID` is represented as a number, but there really is no numeric relationship between the numbers (e.g. someone with an ID = 40 didn't complete the study in twice the time of someone with an ID = 20). Technically, the IDs are ordered based on when they completed the study, but because this information isn't meaningful in the context of our analysis, we can consider this a 'Nominal' variable.

* `Age` is continuous. Someone who is 12 is twice as old as someone who is 6, and you could measure age up to infinite decimal places if you had a perfectly precise measurement. This can be considered a 'Scale' variable.

* `Gender` is nominal. It can be captured in discrete categories and there is no inherent order.

* `SPscore` is a 'Scale' variable. There is a meaningful numeric relationship between the values.

## Using SPSS - Adding Labels

Often, categorical data may be represented as a number. In today's example, the gender variable consists of 3 values which represent the different gender groups that participated in the study. Instead of recording gender as a character label, participants were given a number to reflect their gender group. However, it is important to always include a coding key, so that anyone who works with the data will know how to interpret the numeric labels used and can make appropriate interpretations. SPSS also uses the provided labels in its output, so it can be very helpful when interpreting the results.

### Your Task 
+ Add a label to the Gender variable so that 1 = 'Male', 2 = 'Female', and 3 = 'Nonbinary'. 

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt">Click here for a hint </span></summary>

This should also be done in *Variable View*. The column names may seem a bit misleading; you won’t use the ‘Label’ column for this task.

To associate a label with each value of a variable, you'll use the **Values** column under the **Variable View** tab.

Select the Gender x Values cell and click the dots to bring up the _Value Labels_ box. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week1_values.png')
```

Use the $+$ to add a new label. In the Value column, type the value **exactly as it is recorded in your data.** In the Label column, add the label you would like to associate with that specific value. Continue adding labels using  $+$ until you've labeled all values in the Gender column.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week1_valueLabs.png')
```

Click 'OK'. If you've done this properly, you'll see that each numeric value is now associated with a character label.

## Using SPSS - Inspecting Distributions

Before doing any sort of analysis, it's important to first check the data to make sure everything is as expected. With categorical data, one way to do this is to inspect the frequency and spread of observations in each group. This allows the following to be checked:

+ Are observations distributed as expected?
+ Are there any missing datapoints?
+ (In categorical variables) Are there any groups with a limited number of observations?
+ (In continuous variables) Are there extreme or impossible values?


### Your Tasks
+ Check the distribution of the `Gender` variable using a frequency table and/or a figure
+ Check the distribution of your continuous variables using figures

You may use either bar charts or histograms to visualise frequency distributions, depending on the type of data that you have: 

```{r, echo = F, fig.width= 3.5, fig.height=2.5, message=F}
freqDat <- data.frame(Bar=sample(c('Yes', 'No', 'Maybe'), size = 30, replace = T, prob = c(.25, .25, .5)), 
                      Histogram=rnorm(30, mean = 10, sd = 4))

ggplot(freqDat, aes(Bar)) + geom_bar(fill = accent3, color=accent2) +
  labs(x ='Bar Chart') +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'))

ggplot(freqDat, aes(Histogram)) + geom_histogram(fill = accent3, color=accent2) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'))
  
```



```{r freq, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question_numeric("How many total datapoints do you have for the gender variable?",
              answer(250, correct=T),
              message = 'There are 250 total participants with gender data.'),
     question_numeric("How many female participants are in the sample?",
              answer(118, correct=T),
              message = 'There are 118 females in this sample.'),
     question('Which of the following is appropriate for visualising the frequency distribution of continuous variables?',
              answer('Bar Chart'),
              answer('Histogram', correct = T),
              answer('Both bar charts & histograms can be used for this.'),
              message = 'Histograms should be used to visualise the frequency distribution of a continuous variable. Bar charts should be used to visualise the frequency distribution of a categorical variable.'),
     question('True or False: No participants scored above 70 on the social perception scale.',
              answer('True'),
              answer('False', correct = T),
              message = 'The histogram indicates that one participant achieved a score higher than 70.')
     )
```

The output shows the number of participants in each category, as well as the proportions and total values overall. If you added the labels properly, the table will use them rather than the original numbered data, allowing for ease of interpretation.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%', fig.align= 'center'}

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt">Continuous Variables </span>

Select *Analyze>Descriptives>Frequencies*. Select `Age` and `SPscore` and move them into the 'Variable' box. Uncheck 'Display frequency tables' unless you want to produce massive, unnecessary tables. To produce histograms, select 'Charts...' and choose 'Histograms'. 

Note that you can also produce all plots using the *Graphs* button in the toolbar.

## Using SPSS - Descriptives

When preparing to perform analysis, one of the most important steps is to check the descriptive statistics of your variables. These values are useful summary metrics and may provide insight into patterns in your data.

### Your Tasks
+ Check the appropriate measure of central tendency for `Age`, `Gender`, and `SPscore`
+ Check the standard deviation of `Age` and `SPscore`
+ Check the minimum and maximum values of `Age` and `SPscore`

```{r desc1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Check Your Results',
     question("Which of the following central tendency measures could be used to describe age? Please select all that apply.",
              answer("Mean", correct = T),
              answer("Median", correct = T),
              answer('Mode', correct = T),
              message = 'All of the above could technically be used to describe the Age variable. However, it is most common to use the
              mean, as it includes information from each observation.'),
     question("Which of the following central tendency measures could be used to describe gender?",
              answer("Mean"),
              answer("Median"),
              answer('Mode', correct = T),
              message = 'As a categorical variable, there is no numeric relationship between values in the gender variable. Therefore, 
              the mode is the only measure of central tendency that is appropriate to describe this variable'),
     question_numeric("What is the average score on the Social Perception Scale? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
              answer(54.21, correct=T),
              message = 'The average social perception scale score is 54.21.'),
     question_numeric("How old are the oldest participants in this sample?",
              answer(17, correct=T),
              message = 'The maximum age of the sample is 17.'),
     question_numeric("What is the standard deviation of age? Please round your answer to two decimal places.",
              answer(2.70, correct=T),
              message = 'The standard deviation of the age variable is 2.70.')
)
```

Select *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add the variables of interest into the 'Variable(s)' box. Click 'Statistics' and select the options that you need:

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week1_descriptives.png')
```

Note that `Gender`, as a categorical variable, should only be described using Mode. The other variables can be described using all 3 measures.

## Interpret and Report

Now that you've reviewed your data, write a one or two APA-style sentences describing your sample that you could incorporate into a methods section. When describing your sample, you should **at least** include the following: 

+ $n$ of study
+ Age (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation)
+ Gender ($n$ in each category)

If you are working with data that includes other demographic variables such as race or education, these should be appropriately described as well. You would also include any exclusion/inclusion criteria.

Make sure to use APA style. Once you're finished, compare your paragraph to the solution paragraph. Is there anything you included that is not in the solution? Is there anything you left out?
