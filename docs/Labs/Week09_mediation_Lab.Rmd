## Intro to Today's Lab

During today's lab, you'll apply the concepts discussed during this week's lecture. Each lab consists of a range of tasks, with corresponding questions you can answer. Please note that the questions are not required and not marked, although they do provide a helpful source of formative feedback that will help you gauge your understanding. 

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Use PROCESS macro in SPSS to run mediation analysis
2. Properly interpret and report results from a mediation analysis
3. Produce a visualisation of the mediation model results


## Experiment Overview

This week, you will be analysing simulated data based on a study investigating whether the effect of screen time on children's attention span is mediated by the hours of sleep they get. You can download the data on Learn or [by clicking here](https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week9LabData.sav).

### Your Tasks
+ [ ] $\ $ State your research question(s) for this experiment.
+ [ ] $\ $ Create a diagram of the mediation model you will be testing. You can use whatever software you choose, or simply make a quick drawing by hand.
+ [ ] $\ $ State your hypotheses for this experiment.

The dataset contains the following variables:

```{r, echo = F}
dat <- read.csv('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/Week9LabData.csv')

datInfo <- data.frame(VariableName = colnames(dat),
                      Description=c('Age in years',
                                    'Levels: F = Female; M = Male',
                                    'Amount of screen time per week in hours',
                                    'Amount of sleep per week in hours',
                                    'Scores on an attention span measure; values may range between 50-80'))

datInfo %>%
  kbl(col.names=c('Variable Name', 'Description')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color=baseColor, font_size = 18, align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, width = '4.5cm')
```

With mediation, the primary objective is to test the indirect effect of your predictor upon the outcome (i.e., the effect of the predictor that comes through the mediator), so the statistical hypotheses should be framed in that way.

A possible research question for this study would be:

<i> Does sleep mediate the relationship between screen time and attention span in children? </i>

This diagram reflects the model to be tested:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_mediationMod.png')
```

A basic hypothesis would be:

Sleep mediates the relationship between screen time and attention span in children.

The statistical hypothesis would be:

$\beta_{indirect} \neq 0$

## Data Review

Before running any analyses, you should first check your data. In many cases, some kind of cleaning or data wrangling will be necessary. For instance, are there any missing values? Do you have any unexpected values or extreme outliers? Do you need to create a variable from the existing data (e.g., a summary metric for a cognitive task)? These things should be dealt with before conducting the analyses.

Additionally, you'll need to compute descriptive data. You'll do this for both your main variables of interest and your sample's demographic data, as this must be included in the Sample portion of your Methods section. 

### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Open 'Week9LabData.sav'

+ [ ] $\ $ Check that all variables are set as the correct measurement type. 

+ [ ] $\ $ Check the descriptive statistics of your data

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

For continuous variables, the descriptive statistics to check are mean and standard deviation. It's also useful to check the minimum and maximum so you can easily identify values outside of your expected range. For categorical variables, you'll check the frequency of participants in each group. It may also be useful to check the mode.

* `Age` - Scale

* `Gender` - Nominal

* `Screen` - Scale

* `Sleep` - Scale

* `Att` - Scale

`Age` should be set as scale. Otherwise all variables are coded properly.

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> Check Descriptive Statistics </span>

**Categorical Variables:** The only categorical variable in this week's dataset is `Gender`. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add `Gender` to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is checked, then click 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_genDist.png')
```


**Continuous Variables:** All remaining variables are continuous. Click *Analyze>Descriptive Statistics>Frequencies*, then add these to the 'Variable(s)' box. Make sure 'Display frequency tables' is not ticked, then click 'Statistics'. Tick 'Mean', 'Std. Deviation', 'Minimum', and 'Maximum'. Click 'Continue', then 'OK'. You should see the following output:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_descriptives.png')
```

## Check Assumptions

As the mediation model is comprised of linear regression models, it is not surprising that the assumptions are the same as linear regression: 

(1) Linearity: All predictors variables have a linear relationship with the outcome variable.

(2) Independence of Observations: Individual observations should not be dependent upon any others

(3) Normality: Model residuals are normally distributed

(4) Equal Variance (AKA Homoskedasticity or Homogeneity of Variance): the variance is consistent across both predictor values & fitted values

(5) No Multicollinearity: Predictors should not be highly correlated with each other (e.g., $r$ > .8, VIF < 5)


### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Run the individual regressions that comprise the full mediation model and use results to:

  + [ ] $\ $ Decide whether your data meet the assumption of linearity

  + [ ] $\ $ Decide whether your data meet the assumption of normality

  + [ ] $\ $ Decide whether your data meet the assumption of equal variance

  + [ ] $\ $ Decide whether your data meet the assumption of multicollinearity

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

This mediation model is comprised of the following regression models:

$Sleep_i \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1ScreenTime_i + \epsilon_i$


$Attention_i \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1ScreenTime_i + \beta_2Sleep_i + \epsilon_i$

<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> **Model 1 Assumptions: `Sleep` ~ `Screen` ** </span>

To test this model's assumptions, navigate to  *Analyze > Regression > Linear*. Add your outcome variable, `Sleep`, to the 'Dependent' box and your predictor, `Screen`, to the 'Independent(s)' box.

To produce the histogram, P-P plot, and the plot of residuals by predicted values, click 'Plots', move the ZRESID variable (which reflects the standardized residual) into the Y box and the ZPRED variable (which reflects the standardized model-predicted value of well-being for each individual) into the X box. Make sure both 'Histogram' and 'Normal probability plot' is ticked.

Click 'Continue'. To check for multicollinearity, click 'Statistics' and tick 'Collinearity diagnostics': 

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/PRM/Labs/images/week8_lrStats.png')
```

Click 'Continue' and then 'OK'. 

We will assume that the study design effectively addressed the assumption of independence.

First, have a look at the histogram:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m1Hist.png')
```

In general, we see a nice symmetrical bell curve, with most observations falling near the mean value and fewer observations in the tails. There does not appear to be issues with normality, which the P-P plot confirms:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m1PP.png')
```

All points fall along the black diagonal which indicates where we would expect the data to fall if they were perfectly normal. Based on these two plots, we can assume the data are normal.


Inspection of the residuals by predicted values plot shows a cloud of points, with no unusual patterns: 
```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m1ResidPred.png')
```
This suggests both linearity and homogeneity of variance assumptions are met. 

As this is a simple linear model (only a single predictor), there is no risk of multicollinearity. 


<span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt"> **Model 1 Assumptions: `Attention` ~ `Screen` + `Sleep` ** </span>

Navigate to  *Analyze > Regression > Linear*. Replace `Sleep` with `Att` in the 'Dependent' box and add `Sleep` instead to the 'Independent(s)' box (along with `Screen`). All other settings can be left as is.

Both the histogram and P-P plot indicate that residuals are normally distributed:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m2Hist.png')
```

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m2PP.png')
```

As before, the residuals by predicted values plot shows no issues with nonlinearity or heterogeneity:
```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m2ResidPred.png')
```

A check of the VIF values to assess multicollinearity indicates that the predictors are not problematically correlated:
```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m2VIF.png')
```

## Primary Analysis

You will be testing whether sleep significantly mediates the relationship between screen time and attention span in children. To do this, you'll be using the PROCESS macro to test a mediation model. 


### Your Tasks

+ [ ] $\ $ Run mediation to test your hypotheses and interpret the overall model results with $\alpha$ = .05.

+ [ ] $\ $ Interpret all relevant effects

+ [ ] $\ $ Check and interpret the confidence interval associated with the indirect effect


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

To perform a simple mediation model, navigate to *Analyze > Regression > PROCESS v4.2 by Andrew F. Hayes*. You'll need to select model number 4.

</details>

<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>

Navigate to *Analyze > Regression > PROCESS v4.2 by Andrew F. Hayes*. In the dialogue box, select model number 4 to indicate that you are performing simple mediation. Add the output variable, `Att` to the 'Y variable' box, the predictor, `Screen`, to the 'X variable box', and the mediator, `Sleep`, to the 'Mediator(s) M' box:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_processMod.png')
```

Click Options and select 'Show total effect model'. All other options can be left at default. Click 'Continue'.

Click 'OK'. Because bootstrapping can be computationally intense, it may be a moment before the results appear in the output. 

The first portion of the output shows the variables used in the model. You can use this to confirm you entered everything appropriately. The next portion shows the results from the model that predicted sleep from screen time:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m1Output.png')
```

This output indicates that hours of screen time per week significantly predicted sleep, explaining 21% of the variance in hours of sleep per week. As screen is the only predictor in this model, it is not surprising that both the overall model and screen as an individual predictor are both significant.


The third portion of the output shows the results from the regression model predicting attention from both sleep and screen time. Once again, the overall model is significant, and both screen time and sleep are significant predictors:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_m2Output.png')
```

The final portion of the output is the key result from the mediation analysis:

```{r, echo = F, fig.align= 'center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://mtruelovehill.github.io/ISAP/Labs/images/week9_medEffs.png')
```

This portion includes the indirect effect of screen time on attention. If sleep did not mediate this effect, the true estimate would be equal to 0. However, the bootstrapped confidence interval does not contain 0, suggesting sleep does play a mediating role in the relationship between screen time and attention.

## Interpret & Report 

Now that you've completed the analyses, write a mini results section describing your findings. In this section, please:

+ Give a brief description of your sample as you would in a methods section. 

+ Report your results and a provide an interpretation in APA style. 

+ Produce a diagram that shows your results


<div class="container">
<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for a hint </span></summary>

There are many ways you could write this up, but you should at least include the following information:

+ alpha level
+ number of participants ( $n$)
+ participant demographics (mean age, age $SD$, and age range of sample; gender distribution of sample)
+ descriptive data for each variable ($M$ & $SD$)
+ the type of test used, including number of bootstrapped samples used
+ coefficient results from key models ($\beta$, $SE$, and $p$)
+ Overall model results from the full model ($F$, $df$, $p$, $R^2$)
+ Indirect effect results ($\beta$, $SD$, 95% CI)
+ Comparison between indirect results and total model (partial vs full mediation)

<details><summary><span style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt"> Click here for the solution </span></summary>
Sample data, descriptive data, and assumptions checks can be reported as in previous weeks. Here is an example of how mediation may be reported:

Mediation analysis with PROCESS macro Version 4.2 (Hayes, 2017) was used to investigate the hypothesis that sleep mediates the effect of screen time on attention span in children. Results showed that screen time was a significant predictor of sleep, $\beta$ = -0.52, $SE$ = 0.09, $p$ < .001. Both screen time, $\beta$ = -0.16, $SE$ = 0.08, $p$ = .04, and sleep, $\beta$ = 0.30, $SE$ = 0.07, $p$ < .001, significantly predicted attention span, explaining 25% of its variance, $F$(2, 119) = 20.10, $p$ < .001.

The indirect effect was tested using a percentile bootstrap estimation approach with 5000 samples. These results indicated the indirect coefficient was significant, $\beta$ = -0.16, $SE$ = 0.05, 95% CI[-0.26,-0.07], suggesting that the relationship between screen time and attention span is at least partially explained by sleep. However, screen time remained a significant predictor of attention even after controlling for sleep ($p$ = .04), indicating partial, rather than full, mediation. See Figure 1 for a summary of key results.
