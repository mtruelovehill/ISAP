## This Week's Key Topics

+ Making Hypotheses

+ The Null Distribution

+ `\(p\)`-Values

---

## Why????

+ Psychology is a science....

--

  + with a lot of uncertainty

--

+ To answer our research questions, we rely on empirical evidence 

+ We take measurements that allow us to make systematic observations of our construct of interest, then use these observations to draw conclusions

+ In other words, we gather data and look for consistent patterns within the data that support (or refute) our ideas

+ But how do we decide what is *consistent enough*?

---
## Making Hypotheses

+ **Null Hypothesis ( `\(H_0\)` ):** There is no difference or effect, and any experimentally observed difference is due to chance

+ **Alternative Hypothesis ( `\(H_1\)` ):** There is a relationship or association between variables

+ What does this have to do with statistics?

--

+ The burden of proof is on `\(H_1\)`

  + Assume `\(H_0\)` is accurate until there is sufficient evidence that it is not
  
  + Statistical tests of significance assess strength of the evidence against `\(H_0\)`

---
## Assessing Evidence

+ Statistical tests assess evidence against `\(H_0\)` through **probability**

  + How likely is it that the null hypothesis is true, given the observed data?
  
--

+ In psychology, we design a study, take measurements from a sample, and use these measurements to calculate a value that carries some meaning.

+ We calculate the likelihood of this value occurring under the constraints of `\(H_0\)`

+ We then make a decision of whether to reject `\(H_0\)` based around this likelihood.
  
  + If the observed value is unlikely to occur under `\(H_0\)`, we consider this sufficient evidence to reject `\(H_0\)`
  
  + If the observed value is highly likely to occur under `\(H_0\)`, we do not reject it, because we haven't gathered sufficient evidence against it.

## Continuous Probability Distributions

&gt; Why a range? Why can't we compute the probability of a single score?

&gt; Because technically, continuous values go on infinitely, so the probability of any single value is approximately 0

+ ~95% of our observations are less than 25. This means we only have about a 5% chance of randomly selecting an observation of at least 25.

---
## Continuous Probability Distributions

+ Why does this matter?

--

+ Remember, the statistical tests we will learn about work by testing the probability of our results given the null hypothesis

  + In other words, if the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would get results at least as unusual as ours?

+ If our results are unusual enough, we reject the null hypothesis.

---

## Questions?

---
## Testing Against the Null Hypothesis

+ In order to make a decision whether our data/values are unusual, we need to have an understanding of what values we might expect to see if the null hypothesis were true.

--

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** Given the following distributions, do you think a value of 20 would be unusual?

]



???

+ A value of 20 tells us nothing without context


---
## Null Distributions

+ Most of the tests we cover in this course evaluate significance by evaluating results against a predefined probability distribution known as the **null distribution**

+ The null distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic **given that the null hypothesis is true**. 

+ Each statistical test is associated with a separate null distribution

## Comparing Results to Null Distribution

+ When you run a statistical test, you:

  1. Compute a test statistic based on your data
  
  2. Use the null distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining this statistic if the null were true
  
  3. Use this probability to make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis.

## `\(p\)` - values

+ The `\(p\)`-value is the **probability** of obtaining data at least as extreme as ours, given that the null hypothesis is true.

+ It is not:
  + The likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.
  + The likelihood that our hypothesis is false

+ It provides insight into the strength of our evidence against the null hypothesis. 

+ If we get a `\(p\)`-value past a certain threshold, we consider our results to be **significant**, and we reject `\(H_0\)`

## `\(\alpha\)`

+ The 'threshold' for significance is known as `\(\alpha\)`

+ If the `\(p\)`-value is less than the designated `\(\alpha\)` threshold, we reject `\(H_0\)`

+ But what, exactly, does the `\(\alpha\)` value reflect?

---
## Errors

+ Whether your decision is either to reject or not reject the null hypothesis, you may be making an error.

--

+ Two types of errors:

  + **Type I Error:** You reject a true null hypothesis (i.e., you believe a result is significant when it is not)
  
  + **Type II Error:** You don't reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., you don't think a result is significant when it is)

## `\(\alpha\)`

+ `\(\alpha\)` reflects the probability of making a Type I error

  + The likelihood of rejecting the null when it is actually true 

--
  
+ Typical `\(\alpha\)` value is .05, but may sometimes be set at .01 or .001.

+ If `\(\alpha\)` is .05, it means that we are willing to take a 5% risk of rejecting `\(H_0\)` when we shouldn't


---
## One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

.pull-left[

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

+ With a **one-tailed test**, we're only interested in values in a single tail of a distribution

  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, we check that our observation is in the highest 5% of values *or* the lowest 5% of values

+ With a **two-tailed test**, we're interested in values in both tails of a distribution

## Putting it Together

+ When we run a statistical test, we compare our results against the null distribution, which is the probability of the results, given the null hypothesis is true.

+ If the probability of our outcome (the `\(p\)`-value) is less than the `\(\alpha\)` threshold, it means the outcome falls into the range that we've designated as extreme.

+ Because it's really unlikely that these results would occur if the null hypothesis were true, we consider this to be sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis, and we reject it.
