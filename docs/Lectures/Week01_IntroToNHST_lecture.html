### This Week's Key Topics

+ Making Hypotheses

+ The Null Distribution

+ `\(\alpha\)`

+ `\(p\)`-Values

---

### Why????

+ Psychology is a science....

  + To answer our research questions, we use **empirical evidence**
  + We take measurements of our construct of interest, then use these observations to draw conclusions


--

  + ...with a lot of uncertainty
  
    + Cannot rely on deterministic models
    + Gather data and look for *consistent patterns* within the data that support (or refute) our ideas
    + However, it's not just the raw values in the data that are important, but the variability in these values

### Deterministic vs Probabilistic Models

**Example:** Commuting to School

**Deterministic**

`\(Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed}\)`


&lt;b&gt;Distance to School:&lt;/b&gt; 1.4 miles

&lt;b&gt;Cycling Speed:&lt;/b&gt; 15 miles per hour

&lt;b&gt;Time to School: &lt;/b&gt; ~ 5.5 minutes

### Formulating a Model

+ **Model:** a formal representation of the way the world works

  + Your expectations around your construct of interest

--

+ When you make an alternative hypothesis, you're proposing a model

  + **Alternative Hypothesis ( `\(H_1\)` ):** Your proposed model about how things work

--

+ An alternative hypothesis is always partnered with a null hypothesis

  + **Null Hypothesis ( `\(H_0\)` ):** What you would expect if your model is false

--

+ What does this have to do with statistics?

---
### Testing the Model

+ Statistics provide a way of testing your proposed model.

+ Null-hypothesis statistical tests of significance assess strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis

  + The burden of proof is on the alternative hypothesis

  + Presume null hypothesis is accurate until there is sufficient evidence that it is not

---
### Assessing Evidence

+ Statistical tests assess evidence against the null hypothesis using **probability**

  + How likely is it that the null hypothesis is true, given the observed data?
  
--

+ In psychology, we gather data and calculate the likelihood of these data occurring under the constraints of the null hypothesis

+ We then make a decision of whether to reject the null hypothesis based around this likelihood.
  
  + If the observed data is unlikely to occur under the null hypothesis, we consider this sufficient evidence to reject it
  
  + If the observed data is likely to occur under the null hypothesis, we do not reject it, because we haven't gathered sufficient evidence against it.

### Probability Distributions

+ Probability distributions allow you to make a general estimate about the likelihood of an observation occurring.

&gt; Why a range? Why can't we compute the probability of a single score?

&gt; The probability of an observation is split between all possible values

&gt; Technically, continuous values go on infinitely, so the probability of any single value is approximately 0

+ If we randomly select an observation from our data, what is the likelihood it will be at least 25?

+ ~95% of our observations are less than 25. This means we only have about a 5% chance of randomly selecting an observation of at least 25.

---
### Continuous Probability Distributions

+ Why does this matter?

--

+ Remember, the statistical tests we will learn about work by testing the probability of our results given the null hypothesis

  + In other words, if the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would get results at least as unusual as ours?

+ If our results are unusual enough, we reject the null hypothesis.

## Questions?

---
### Testing Against the Null Hypothesis

+ In order to make a decision whether our data/values are unusual, we need to know what values we would expect if the null hypothesis were true.


--

&gt; **Test Your Understanding:** Given the following distributions, would you consider a value of 20 to be unusual?

]

--

.pull-right[
![](Week01_IntroToNHST_lecture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]



???

+ A value of 20 tells us nothing without context


---
### Null Distributions

+ The distribution against which the value we've obtained from our data is evaluated is known as the **null distribution.**

+ Each statistical test is associated with it's own null distribution

+ The null distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic **given that the null hypothesis is true**.

### Comparing Results to Null Distribution

When you run a statistical test, you:

  1. Compute a test statistic based on your data
  
  2. Use the null distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining this statistic if the null were true
  
  3. Use this probability to make a decision whether to reject the null hypothesis.

### `\(p\)` - values

.pull-left[
+ The `\(p\)`-value is the **probability** of obtaining data at least as extreme as ours, given that the null hypothesis is true.

+ It is not:
  + The likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.
  + The likelihood that our hypothesis is false

### `\(p\)` - values

.pull-left[
+ The `\(p\)`-value is the **probability** of obtaining data at least as extreme as ours, given that the null hypothesis is true.

+ It is not:
  + The likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.
  + The likelihood that our hypothesis is false

+ It provides insight into the strength of our evidence against the null hypothesis. 

+ If the `\(p\)`-value is below a certain threshold, we consider the results to be **significant**, and the null hypothesis is rejected

]

---
## `\(\alpha\)`

+ The 'threshold' for significance is known as `\(\alpha\)`

+ If the `\(p\)`-value is less than the predetermined `\(\alpha\)` threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected

+ But what, exactly, does the `\(\alpha\)` value reflect?


---
### Errors

+ Whether the decision is made to either to reject or not reject the null hypothesis, you may be making an error.

+ Basically, what you find in your sample isn't actually what is true of the population

--

+ Two types of errors:

  + **Type I Error:** You reject a true null hypothesis (i.e., you suggest there is an effect or association when there really isn't)
  
  + **Type II Error:** You don't reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., you don't find an effect or association that actually exists)


---

## `\(\alpha\)`

+ `\(\alpha\)` reflects the probability of making a Type I error

+ It is the likelihood of rejecting the null when it is actually true 

+ You choose your desired `\(\alpha\)` value before you run any analyses.
  
  + The most commonly used `\(\alpha\)` is .05, but may sometimes be set at .01 or .001.
  
+ If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, it means there is a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it shouldn't be rejected.

### One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

.pull-left[

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

### One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

.pull-left[

+ When evaluating evidence against `\(H_0\)`, our threshold for what values are considered to be *extreme* depends on whether we're running a one-tailed or two-tailed test.

+ With a **one-tailed test**, we're only interested in values in a single tail of a distribution

  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, we check that our observation is in the highest 5% of values *or* the lowest 5% of values

+ With a **two-tailed test**, we're interested in values in both tails of a distribution

  + If `\(\alpha\)` is set at .05, we check that our observation is in the *most extreme* 5% of values, whether they are higher or lower

---
### Putting it Together

+ When we run a statistical test, we compare our results against the null distribution, which is the probability of the results given the null hypothesis is true.

+ If the probability of our outcome (the `\(p\)`-value) is less than the `\(\alpha\)` threshold, it means the outcome falls into the range that we've designated as extreme.

+ Because it's really unlikely that these results would occur if the null hypothesis were true, we consider this to be sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis, and we reject it.
